YUI Local Loader
================

A simple YUI 3 combo loader written in PHP 5.3 with minimal dependencies.  The loader
should work in a friendly manner with existing applications and frameworks.  APC is 
optionally used for caching responses.

Remaining Tasks
---------------

* Add http://deltasys.com/license/new-bsd page
* Detect whether client accepts gzip encoded responses
* Support alternate module sources for combo-loading of application Javascript
* Unit tests
